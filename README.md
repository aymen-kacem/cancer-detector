Breast Cancer Classification and Visualization Project 🎗️📊

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification and Visualization project! 🚀 This repository contains a Python-based implementation of machine learning techniques to analyze, visualize, and classify breast cancer data from the famous sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer dataset.

Features ✨

Data Exploration 🧐:


Statistical summaries of the dataset 📋

Heatmaps and correlation matrices for feature relationships 🔥

Histograms and KDE plots for individual feature distributions 📈

Outlier Detection 🚨:

Identifies outliers using Z-scores to ensure clean and reliable data ✂️

Machine Learning Models 🤖:

Support Vector Machines (SVM) with multiple kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) 🧪

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification 📍

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV 🔍

Cross-validation to evaluate model performance 📊

Evaluation Metrics 📋:
