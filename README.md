Breast Cancer Classification and Visualization Project 🎗️📊

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification and Visualization project! 🚀 This repository contains a Python-based implementation of machine learning techniques to analyze, visualize, and classify breast cancer data from the famous sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer dataset.

Features ✨

- Data Exploration 🧐:


Statistical summaries of the dataset 📋

Heatmaps and correlation matrices for feature relationships 🔥

Histograms and KDE plots for individual feature distributions 📈

- Outlier Detection 🚨:

Identifies outliers using Z-scores to ensure clean and reliable data ✂️

- Machine Learning Models 🤖:

Support Vector Machines (SVM) with multiple kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) 🧪

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification 📍

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV 🔍

Cross-validation to evaluate model performance 📊

- Evaluation Metrics 📋:

Confusion matrices, precision, recall, and classification reports 📜

Validation curves to analyze the impact of hyperparameters 🎯

- Visualization 🎨:

Scatter plots of predictions vs. actual values ✏️

Heatmaps and histograms for data exploration 🔎

- Usage 📂

Dataset: The project uses the built-in load_breast_cancer dataset from sklearn. 🩺

Visualization: All visualizations, including correlation matrices and histograms, are displayed using matplotlib and seaborn. 🎨

Models: Train and evaluate machine learning models with customizable hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. 🔧

- Key Results 📊
